## Requirements

Python 3 with the following packages:
    
* Pandas v0.24

* Matplotlib v3.0.3

* Numpy v1.16

* itertools v2.3

## Running Instructions

To run the program:

1. Run the MAIN.py program

2. Wait for the data to be loaded from the raw excel files and be cleaned (~15 seconds)

3. Wait for the Python database to be generated (~5 seconds)

4. Follow the in-terminal prompts to plot nuclear power generation statistics

5. When finished you may export the plotted data following prompts

6. If re-running the program you will not need to wait for steps 2.

In the main folder you will find the original data that drives the program in the 
'data/virgin_data' directory.

In the 'data/gif' and 'data/gif_log' directories you will find interesting visualizations
created by the visualization program
