## Requirements

-Python 3 with the following packages:

    -Matplotlib v3.0.3
    -Numpy v1.16
    -itertools v2.3

## Running Instructions

To run the program:
    1. Run the MAIN.py program
    2. Wait for the data to be loaded from the raw excel files and be cleaned (~15 seconds)
    3. Wait for the Python database to be generated (~5 seconds)
    4. Follow the in-terminal prompts to plot nuclear power generation statistics
    5. When finished you may export the plotted data following prompts
    6. If re-running the program you will not need to wait for steps 2.

In the main folder you will find the original data that drives the program in the 
'data/virgin_data' directory.

In the 'data/gif' and 'data/gif_log' directories you will find interesting visualizations
created by the visualization program
